# Day 2 - DevOps Task

## Overview
This repository contains the tasks and exercises for **Day 2** of the DevOps training program. The focus is on setting up and using Jenkins for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), using Maven for project management, and working with Docker Compose for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Additionally, you will configure Jenkins in a Master-Slave configuration and create both Free Style and Pipeline jobs.

This branch (`day2`) covers the setup and configuration of essential tools used in modern DevOps pipelines.
