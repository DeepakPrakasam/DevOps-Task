# Day 3 - DevOps Task

## Overview
Today was all about getting hands-on with **Minikube**! I installed Minikube, which is a tool that lets you run a local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing. I also practiced some essential Minikube commands that will be useful for managing Kubernetes clusters locally. This session was a great way to get familiar with the basics of Kubernetes before diving deeper into more complex topics.
